Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text
characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations,
called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after
Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph.
Morse Code, either of two systems for representing letters of the alphabet,
numerals, and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots, dashes, and
spaces. The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths
or analogous mechanical or visual signals, such as flashing lights. One of
the systems was invented in the United States by American artist and
inventor Samuel F.B. Morse during the 1830s for electrical telegraphy.
This version was further improved by American scientist and businessman
Alfred Lewis Vail, Morse’s assistant and partner. Soon after its
introduction in Europe, it became apparent that the original Morse Code
was inadequate for the transmission of much non-English text, since it
lacked codes for letters with diacritic marks. The original “American”
Morse Code invented by Samuel F.B. Morse is hardly in use today.
However, International Morse Code is still used by U.S. Navy intelligence
specialists, amateur radio operator afficionados who form the
International Morse Code Preservation Society, and aviators who
communicate abbreviated identifiers via Morse Code.
